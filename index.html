            <h5>1. A Hotel Site</h5>
            <p>
              This is a three-page website design presenting a some fictional hotel’s offer that I created in Canva to practise applying Web Design Principles relating to things like Color Theory or Typography. Actually it isn’t my own work because it is based on the similar project created by the tutor of the online course I’m taking. But I believe that I managed to make some significant modifications in it and my design has a different style. By using specific font styles and colours I was trying to make a potential website look both original and elegant and I hope it worked out at least in some way.

            <h5>2. CSS Paintings</h5>
            <p>
              While the previous work is merely based on the one made by my online course’s tutor, this one is a complete copy of her two other projects. But being creative wasn’t an essence of this exercise. Indeed, the point was to be able to copy particular things using only CSS. As you can see below, we have two kind of pictures here. The first one, the flag, is almost entirely made from div blocks and the second one, which is a Piet Mondrian’s artwork, was created using a Grid layout. They both show the power of CSS but if you master your skills, you can create much more complex pictures.

            <h5>3. Pricing Table</h5>
            <p>
              This was also an exercise that consisted in making a copy of an existing work made by someone else (again, by my online course’s tutor). It’s a typical example of pricing table you can come across while visiting websites selling subscriptions. Here we have a Flexbox layout that was used twice – both to cover all three subscription plans and within each of them. It is also worth to mention that if the browser’s viewport shrinks to a specific size, the main flex container changes its direction from row to column which means that membership options lay down not horizontally (like below) but vertically.

            <h5>4. Tin-dog</h5>
            <p>
              Considering all my HTML & CSS projects that are reconstructions of my online course’s tutor work, this one is the most complex. Quite funny webpage, looks like a dog version of Tinder. Working on it gave me an understanding of Bootstrap (it’s one of the CSS frameworks) as each section of the page (there are five) was built by using basic Bootstrap Snippet or Bootstrap Custom Component (including Hero and Pricing). I realized that it was a great way to design an elegant mobile-first website in a short time.

            <h5>5. 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' Game</h5>
            <p>
              In contrast with my previous projects, this one shows my programming skills (rather than web development skills). It’s a game I made using C# that is based on a popular game show, ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?’. Although it is simply a console application (so no impressive artwork here), I think it imitates the show in a pretty good way (there are lifelines, guarantee points, and so on) and has a quite user-friendly interface. Actually it’s not finished yet because I have to change the language to English (now it’s Polish, my native one) and make up more questions, but the most important thing, which is logic, has been already set.

          <h4>Cinematography</h4>
          <img src="./assets/images/cinema.jpg" width="230px" alt="a screening room"/>
          <p>
            Watching movies is my passion from childhood when I used to go to the cinema regularly, especially to watch latest Disney animated feature films. As I was growing up, I was watching more and more and I discovered such classics as <span>Taxi Driver</span> by Martin Scorsese and <span>Apocalypse Now</span> by Francis Ford Coppola. I saw so many different ways to tell a story through pictures and this made me totally fall in love with Cinema. Nowadays, I really like watching independent films whose directors can show on the screen what they really want without considering producers' restrictions, but I believe that almost every movie has a potential to move us deeply in some way and teach us a lesson. Moreover it is very exciting to analyze a movie (e.g. its narrative structure) and realize that every small detail can have a hidden meaning. Although I have seen about two thousand films up till now, I am sure there are still plenty of other ones that are worth seeing.

          <img src="./assets/images/coding.jpg" width="230px" alt="code fragment visible on the laptop screen" />
          <p>
            Actually I am interested in not only coding but also creating websites using HTML and CSS (found out it is not considered as programming). What fascinates me the most about these two activities is that you are able to create things from scratch. It can be either something useful like a mobile application or a work of art like a kind of painting made using only CSS and a piece of HTML. I consider myself still a beginner, but I have already noticed that in fact, as regards this line of work, the only thing that limits you is your imagination. And, of course, level of skills which I try to develop every day hoping one day I will be able to put all my ideas into effect.
